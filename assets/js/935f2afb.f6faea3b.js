When you have code that runs asynchronously, Jest Lua needs to know when the code it is testing has completed, before it can move on to another test. Jest Lua has several ways to handle this.","sidebar":"docs"},"cli":{"id":"cli","title":"runCLI Options","description":"The Jest packages exports runCLI, which is the main entrypoint to run Jest Lua tests. In your entrypoint script, import runCLI from the Jest package. A basic entrypoint script can look like the following:","sidebar":"api"},"configuration":{"id":"configuration","title":"Configuring Jest","description":"The Jest Lua philosophy is to work great by default, but sometimes you just need more configuration power.","sidebar":"api"},"deviations":{"id":"deviations","title":"Deviations","description":"The Jest Lua alignment effort aims to map as closely to Jest\'s API as possible, but there are a few places where language deviations require us to omit functionality or deviate our approach. Deviations are also sometimes made to maintain Lua-nativity. Any user-facing deviations are documented here.","sidebar":"docs"},"expect":{"id":"expect","title":"Expect","description":"When you\'re writing tests, you often need to check that values meet certain conditions. expect gives you access to a number of \\"matchers\\" that let you validate different things.","sidebar":"api"},"getting-started":{"id":"getting-started","title":"Getting Started","description":"The Jest Lua API is similar to the API used by JavaScript Jest.","sidebar":"docs"},"jest-benchmark":{"id":"jest-benchmark","title":"JestBenchmark","description":"Benchmarks are useful tools for gating performance in CI, optimizing code, and capturing performance gains. JestBenchmark aims to make it easier to write benchmarks in the Luau language."},"jest-object":{"id":"jest-object","title":"The Jest Object","description":"The methods in the jest object help create mocks and let you control Jest Lua\'s overall behavior.","sidebar":"api"},"mock-function-api":{"id":"mock-function-api","title":"Mock Functions","description":"Mock functions are also known as \\"spies\\", because they let you spy on the behavior of a function that is a direct (or indirect) collaborator of the module you\'re trying to test, rather than only testing the output. You can create a mock function with jest.fn(). If no implementation is given, the mock function will return nil when invoked.","sidebar":"api"},"mock-functions":{"id":"mock-functions","title":"Mock Functions","description":"Mock functions allow you to test the links between code by erasing the actual implementation of a function, capturing calls to the function (and the parameters passed in those calls), capturing instances of constructor functions when instantiated with new, and allowing test-time configuration of return values.","sidebar":"docs"},"setup-teardown":{"id":"setup-teardown","title":"Setup and Teardown","description":"Often while writing tests you have some setup work that needs to happen before tests run, and you have some finishing work that needs to happen after tests run. Jest Lua provides helper functions to handle this.","sidebar":"docs"},"snapshot-testing":{"id":"snapshot-testing","title":"Snapshot Testing","description":"Snapshot tests are a very useful tool whenever you want to make sure your UI does not change unexpectedly.","sidebar":"docs"},"testez-migration":{"id":"testez-migration","title":"Migrating from TestEZ","description":"If you are using TestEZ, migrating to Jest Lua v2.4.x should be fairly straightforward. Many parts of Jest Lua v2.x still use the TestEZ API.","sidebar":"docs"},"timer-mocks":{"id":"timer-mocks","title":"Timer Mocks","description":"The Lua and Roblox native timer functions (i.e., delay(), tick(), os.time(), os.clock()) are less than ideal for a testing environment since they depend on real time to elapse. Jest Lua can swap out timers with functions that allow you to control the passage of time. Great Scott!","sidebar":"docs"},"upgrading-to-jest3":{"id":"upgrading-to-jest3","title":"From v2.x to v3.x","description":"Upgrading Jest Lua from v2.x or TestEZ to v3.x?
